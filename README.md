# sift-flann-object-detection-bestWay
This project implements object detection using SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and FLANN-based Matcher. The goal is to identify a specific object within a larger image by detecting and matching key features. By applying homography transformation, the object's position is accurately determined and highlighted in the target image.
